# Property Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the Property Price Prediction Project! This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project aimed at predicting property prices based on various features, including property type, location, amenities, and market trends. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and optimization to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict property prices using machine learning techniques. This helps stakeholders such as real estate agents, property owners, and buyers make data-driven decisions in the housing market.

Key objectives include:
•	Building a robust predictive model.

•	Gaining insights into the factors affecting property prices.

•	Optimizing model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

## Features
This project includes the following features:

•	Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data formats.


•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized and analyzed relationships between features and the target variable (price).


•	Feature Engineering:

Encoding categorical features using One-Hot Encoding and Target Encoding.
   
   Creating interaction terms to capture relationships between variables.
   
   Scaling numerical features using Min-Max Scaling for consistent model input.
   
   
•	Model Development: Trained multiple regression models including:

o	Linear Regression

o	Ridge Regression

o	Random Forest Regressor

o	XGBoost Regressor

o	Gradient Boosting Regressor

•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.

## Project Workflow
The workflow of this project includes the following steps:

1.	Data Preprocessing:
   
o	Handled missing values and standardized the dataset.

o	Encoded categorical features.


2.	EDA:
   
o	Visualized trends such as property price vs. location and price vs. size.

o	Investigated correlations between variables.


3.	Model Training:
   
o	Evaluated multiple regression models.

o	Fine-tuned parameters for the best-performing models.


4.	Evaluation:
   
o	Evaluated models using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R² Score.

o	The Random Forest Regressor performed the best with an R² score of 0.42 on the test set.

##Results

•	Best Model: Random Forest Regressor


•	Performance Metrics:

o	Test Mean Squared Error (MSE): 58889.91

o	Test Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 52.76

o	Test R² Score: 0.42

The model provides moderate predictive capability, with opportunities for improvement through additional data or advanced modeling techniques.

## Future Work

Potential enhancements for this project include:

1.	Incorporating External Data: Adding data on economic indicators, neighborhood crime rates, and school quality.
   
2.	Feature Selection: Using advanced methods like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to optimize input features.
   
3.	Deep Learning Models: Exploring neural networks for better predictive accuracy.
   
4.	Deployment: Building a web app or API to make predictions accessible to end users.
