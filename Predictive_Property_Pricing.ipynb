    "The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts property prices in major cities. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing key features such as room type, cleanliness rating, guest satisfaction, distance from city center, and proximity to metro stations, the project will unveil the factors that significantly influence property prices. The model will enable property owners, real estate agents, and investors to make informed decisions about pricing, investment, and property management strategies."
